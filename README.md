# text_generation_using_miniature_gpt
The "Text Generation Using Miniature GPT" project aims to build a lightweight version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) for generating coherent and contextually relevant text. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this project focuses on creating a compact and efficient text generation model suitable for applications with limited computational resources.
